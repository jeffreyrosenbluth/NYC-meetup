<cchalmers>	martingale: adjacent square showing a small gap where shouldn't be any
[12:41:50:PM]  <martingale>	cchalmers ah yes, thanks
[12:41:54:PM]  <cchalmers>	was discussed a little in
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/diagrams-discuss/fLfPlpXEBiQ
[01:12:35:PM]  <byorgey>	martingale: sounds like fun!  Other suggestions: you could include
  fun bugs like how rays sometimes
  pass right through a joint without registering an intersection
[01:15:05:PM]  <byorgey>	martingale: another fun gotcha is how  ...
  # ( rotate alpha <> translateX 2 )  and   ... # transform
  ( rotation alpha <> translationX 2 )  give different results
[01:17:00:PM]  <fryguybob>	Another:  (t # translate v) # strokeT  vs
  (t # strokeT) # translate v  can be surprising especially when TrailLike is involved
